This project is considered to be the most economic technique to impart education uniformly to students of ODU living at far distant regions. In this web application, for demo purpose we have stored few chapters of 'C programming' in our database. Database can be updated to provide information about some other topics. In order for the user to evaluate himself, a test is provided consisting of objective type questions at the end of all chapters.

Technology: ASP.NET, SQL server database
